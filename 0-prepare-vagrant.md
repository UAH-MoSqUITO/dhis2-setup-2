# Prepare virtual machine using Vagrant

* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

* Initialize `Vagrantfile`

    ```shell
    vagrant init bento/ubuntu-18.04
    ```

    ```console
    $ vagrant init bento/ubuntu-18.04
    A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
    ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
    the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
    `vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
    ```
